# Style guide and template

Style guide and template for written work on the Music Technology, Sound Production and Audio Technology programmes at the University of Wolverhampton.

The template makes use of Pandoc, LaTeX and BibTeX. You will need to install Pandoc and LaTeX, and a reference/citation manager which either works with, or can output, BibTeX files. Most reference software can do this. Good BibTeX citation managers include BibDesk (MacOS) and JabRef (cross platform).

Pandoc, LaTeX and BibDesk are already installed on the Macs in the labs. All software runs on Mac, Windows and Linux.

BibDesk (OS X): <http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/>

JabRef (cross platform): <http://jabref.sourceforge.net/>
