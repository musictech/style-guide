# Style guide and template

Style guide and template for written work on the Music Technology, Sound Production and Audio Technology programmes at the University of Wolverhampton.

The template makes use of Pandoc, LaTeX and BibTeX. You will need to install Pandoc and LaTeX, and we recommend the use of a BibTeX manager (we recommend either BibDesk or JabRef). Pandoc, LaTeX and BibDesk are already installed on the Macs in the labs.

Pandoc: <http://pandoc.org/installing.html>

BibDesk (OS X): <http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/>

JabRef (cross platform): <http://jabref.sourceforge.net/>
